//Exercise 9: Log the remainder
//x after the calculation
const x = 7;
const calculationX = x % 3;
console.log(`this is the remainder from 7/3 ➽ ${calculationX}(left over)`);
//y after the calculation
const y = 21;
const calculationY = y % 4;
console.log(`this is the remainder from 21/4 ➽ ${calculationY}(left over)`);
//z after the calculation
const z = 13;
const calculationZ = z % 2;
console.log(`this is the remainder from 13/2 ➽ ${calculationZ}(left over)`);
